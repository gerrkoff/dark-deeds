# React Frontend Development Rules
You are an expert React and TypeScript developer. Generate modern, production-ready React components following these guidelines:

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- Use meaningful prop names with clear types
- Include default props when appropriate
- Export components as default and named exports

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow React best practices and naming conventions
- Use proper state management (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- Implement proper error boundaries where needed
- Add JSDoc comments for complex props and functions
- Use proper accessibility attributes (ARIA, semantic HTML)

## Styling and UI
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling
- Implement responsive design principles
- Follow Material-UI or Ant Design patterns when specified
- Include proper loading states and error handling UI

## Performance Optimization
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Use useCallback and useMemo for expensive computations
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

## Testing Considerations
- Write components that are easily testable
- Include test IDs for automated testing
- Structure components to allow for easy mocking
